        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a tasty turkey brine recipe for any poultry. It will make your bird very juicy, and gravy to die for!
            This is enough brine for a 10- to 18- pound turkey.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>This brine is easy to throw together with ingredients you probably already have on hand. Here's what you'll
            need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Vegetable Broth
                    </strong><br>You can use store-bought or homemade vegetable broth as the base for this recipe.
                    Chicken broth will also work if that's what you have on hand.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Salt</strong><br>Sea salt infuses the bird with savory flavor through osmosis. It also helps
                    keep the meat tender and juicy.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Rosemary, Sage, Thyme, and Savory</strong><br>Earthy herbs and spices like rosemary, sage,
                    thyme, and savory (an aromatic herb in the mint family) add flavor and complexity.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Water</strong><br>Ice water adds volume to the brine. Plus, it keeps the turkey juicy and
                    tender.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine vegetable broth, sea salt, rosemary, sage, thyme, and savory in a large stock pot. Bring to a
                boil, stirring frequently to be sure salt is dissolved. Remove from heat, and let cool to room
                temperature.</li>
            <li>When the broth mixture is cool, pour it into a clean 5-gallon bucket. Stir in the ice water.</li>
            <li>Rinse and dry your turkey. Make sure you have removed the innards. Place the turkey, breast down, into
                the brine. Make sure that the cavity gets filled. Place the bucket in the refrigerator for 8 hours, or
                overnight.</li>
            <li>Remove the turkey carefully, draining off the excess brine and pat dry. Discard excess brine.</li>
            <li>Cook the turkey as desired reserving the drippings for gravy. Keep in mind that brined turkeys cook 20
                to 30 minutes faster so watch the temperature gauge.</li>
        </ol>
